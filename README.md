# KWIC-SH-OO
This program uses a KWIC (Key-Word-In-Context) search-and-sort alogrithm to list every iteration of a given line of text by shifting each word in a line by one and arranging them in alphabetical order, while also omitting  any lines that begin with any of the given noise words.

The program takes in command line arguments to function and should be ran with the following format in a Linux enviornment: 
  - *./a.out 'input_filename' 'noise_words_filename'*
